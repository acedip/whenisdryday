ReMarkdown — Display HTML as Markdown text
ReMarkdown is a CSS experiment and reusable stylesheet for displaying simple HTML text as its Markdown equivalent. To get a feel of what it does, look at the HTML source of this very page.

What’s the point?
Well, if you love Markdown, or want your simple HTML pages to look deceptively like good old plain text, the remarkdown.css stylesheet is for you!

I don’t really expect this stylesheet to be widely used, and don’t even know if I’ll use it myself. But it was a nice CSS challenge to work on: no background images, no borders, only plain text characters.

Browser support:
All modern, CSS 2.1-compliant browsers should handle these styles with ease. There might be minor issues on IE8. IE7 is not supported.

Basic usage
An example HTML page using ReMarkdown would look like this:

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Using ReMarkdown</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="remarkdown.css">
</head>
<body class="rmd-on">
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Goodnight, and good luck.</p>
</body>
</html>
You will need to download a copy of remarkdown.css, and put it in the same directory as your HTML page. Note that we need to declare the rmd-on class somewhere in the document: on the body element, on a container article or div element, your call.

See the details page for available options.
